## Q: What is global warming?

_ A: Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.18 degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.

The result? A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10 warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005—and the 5 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Climate change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but numerous studies, including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, have disproved this claim. The impacts of global warming are already harming people around the world.

Now climate scientists have concluded that we must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 if we are to avoid a future in which everyday life around the world is marked by its worst, most devastating effects: the extreme droughts, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and other disasters that we refer to collectively as climate change. These effects are felt by all people in one way or another but are experienced most acutely by the underprivileged, the economically marginalized, and people of color, for whom climate change is often a key driver of poverty, displacement, hunger, and social unrest.

Q: What causes global warming?
A: Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally this radiation would escape into space, but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. These heat-trapping pollutants—specifically carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated gases—are known as

## Step 5: Manage your invoices and payment methods

Before you start working with resources in your account, familiarize yourself with where you can manage your payment method and access your invoices.

### Managing your payment method
- To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Payments**.
- To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to [IBM Billing](https://login.ibm.com/authsvc/mtfim/sps/authsvc?PolicyId=urn:ibm:security:authentication:asf:basicldapuser&Target=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.ibm.com%2Foidc%2Fendpoint%2Fdefault%2Fauthorize%3FqsId%3D43033be1-d498-4633-bd31-babd52037543%26client_id%3DMyIBMDallasProdCI).

### Accessing your invoices
- To access an invoice for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**.
- To access an invoice for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**. Then, click **IBM Invoices**.

## Step 7: Create your resource groups

Resource groups provide a way for you to easily manage access to multiple resources and to view billage usage for a set of resources. With your Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create more resource groups in addition to the default resource group that's included when you first created your Lite account.

1. Go to **Manage** > **Account** > **Account resources** > **Resource groups**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter a name for your resource group, and click **Add**.
See [What makes a good resource group strategy?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#resource-group-strategy) for details about how to optimally organize resources in your resource groups.

## Step 9: Invite users to your account
You're ready to invite users to your account and grant them access based on the resources they will work with and the tasks they'll perform. If you want users to create resources from the catalog and assign the resources to a resource group, the following access is required:

- Viewer role or higher on the resource group.
- Editor or administrator role on the service.

Complete the following steps:
1. Go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Users**.
2. Click **Invite users**.
3. Specify the email address of the user. If you are inviting more than one user, they are all assigned the same access.
4. Add the user to one or more of the access groups that you created in the previous step.
5. Click **Invite**.
