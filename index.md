## Value of Code Documentation

Code documentation is the collection of easy to understand images and written descriptions that explain what a codebase does and how it can be used.

It can be simple explanatory comments above functions and blocks, or a full-fledged developer handbook, complete with prescriptive style dos-and-don'ts, overviews of each part of the application, and approaches to the most common types of coding tasks.

It's often best to find a happy medium between these two extremes when you make the conscious decision to comment your code and outline the gnarlier areas of a codebase in plain language.

# Sample Index File
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):


This is just a trial to check if edit works
